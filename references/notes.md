# Notes

- UX: select lines, create threaded comments, suggest changes, collapse threads, gutter indicators.
- Storage: persist threads under .code-review (workspace-local, configurable), referencing file + line/range + commit/diff context.
- Views: inline comment UI + a separate panel listing all comments in the workspace.
- Ops: easy command to clear/reset all comments.
