Experiment: `vscode-local-code-review`

## Goal

Build a VS Code extension that enables GitHub/Gerrit-style local code reviews: inline/threaded comments on diffs, stored in .code-review (configurable), with a review panel and reset flow.

## Contents

- `index.md`: this file
- `notes.md`: free-form notes and hypotheses
- `links.md`: websites/blogs/docs/API pages
- `repos/`: cloned GitHub repos (gitignored)

## Repos

| Repo | Local path | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `microsoft/vscode` | `repos/microsoft/vscode` | cloned (gh:ssh) |
| `microsoft/vscode-docs` | `repos/microsoft/vscode-docs` | cloned (gh:ssh) |
